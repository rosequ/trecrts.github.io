Real-Time Summarization (RTS) is a new track at the 2016 [Text
Retrieval Conference (TREC)](http://trec.nist.gov) that represents a
merger of the Microblog (MB) track, which has been running since 2010,
and the Temporal Summarization (TS) track, which has been running
since 2013. The creation of RTS is designed to leverage synergies
between the two tracks in exploring prospective information needs over
document streams containing novel and evolving information.
